# Tsunami
This is a tsunami simulation tool, utilizing the non-linear coupled partial differential shallow water equations. These equations are discretized in a computer model. This project can be applied to any location on earth, for tsunami forecasting and risk analysis. The code found in the code/ folder is in ipython notebook format, and can be accessed, editted, and output viewed interactively through "Jupyter Notebooks" by Anaconda.
## data
Bathymetry data is needed for this project, and should be placed as a netCDF file in data/bathymetry.nc. Bathymetry data for results in this project were obtianed from GEBco.
## results
Results can be viewed in the results/ folder as images, or within the interactive jupyter notebook the code is embedded in.
