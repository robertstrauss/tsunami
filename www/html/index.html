        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>Tsunamis cause major devastation, kill thousands, destroy cities across wide regions and act far from the source. limiting warnings.
Indonesia experienced two major Tsunamis in just one year
Question
Can the damage of a tsunami be forecasted?
Can an accurate, real-time tsunami forecasting system, affordable in developing countries, provide early warning and thus save lives?
I created a real-time physics-based tsunami hazard forecasting system and validated it on case studies.
My code replaces a supercomputer with a graphics card, making it affordable to agencies in developing countries.</p>

        <h1>The Shallow Water Equations</h1>
<p>
Non-linear differential equations describing surface waves
h - bathymetry (depth)
η - surface height deviation
u - X speed (East)
v - Y speed (North)
f - Coriolis force ∝ sin(latitude)
κ  - viscous damping
μ - friction coefficient

        <h1>The 2018 Palu Tsunami</h1>
<p>More than 800 people were killed.
Over 500 were severely injured.
48,000 were made homeless
The inundation was greater than expected for the 7.5 magnitude of the earthquake. Why?
Despite the frequent earthquakes, Palu hadn’t previously experienced such devastation
</p><p>The highest waves crested
near the mouth of the bay, and suddenly rose again at Palu City

    <div class="p">
        <h1>approach</h1>
<p>ndependent variable: Initiate tsunamis in various places around Palu

Dependent variable: Resulting maximum water heights in Palu bay</p>

    <div class="p">
        <h1>palu results</h1>
        <p>Does the harbor’s shape influence damage at Palu city?
          YES:  Wave amplitude preserved by bay shape, and grows in amplitude as it enters the shallows near the city
          Does the damage at Palu city depend on the initial location of the tsunami?
          YES: Maximum wave height grows at tip  ot Palu Bay and City is protected when Tsunami initial locations not directly aligned with bay axis
          Does the initial wave shape have an effect?
          NO: Results insensitive to all waves tested ( Seismic, Round, eliptical, and varied oreintations of elipse).  Insensitive to initial amplitide.
</p>
    </div>
    <div class="p">
        <h1>analasys</h1>
        <p>Correctly predicted even larger maximum wave heights near the mouth of the bay, where the highest waves really were.
Tsunamis are more severe in Palu when north of the angle of Palu bay.
But tsunamis can be guided to Palu by the coast.
Type of tsunami had small effect
Bathymetry amplifies impact: channels and slopes

    <div class="k">
        <h1>The 2018 Krakatoa Tsunami</h1>
<p>Killed over 500 people.
Over 1400 severely injured.
Krakatau volcano’s previous 1883 explosion killed over 30,000 people
waves reached beyond India.Coincidentally this project was in the midst of simulating this event when the tragedy happened, changing the scope from prediction to forecast validation.

        <h1>high performance computing implementation</h1>
        I wrote over 1,341 lines of code, including simulation, unit tests, and graphics
        My Own Implementation: Differential equations, time step integrator written from scratch.
        Two versions of code that run on personal computer with a graphics card
        Massively parallel code allows tens of thousands of threads on thousands of GPU cores.
        28 times faster than real time over regions greater than 20,000 sq. kilometers
        Parallel and SIMD vector operations on multi-core CPU
        User Interface: Merges Code and Output Graphics into a single iPython lab notebook output.

    </div>
    <div class="g">
        <h1>verification</h1>
<p>Verified implementation matches physics of known test cases
  ock in a Pond Unit Test
  Time Series of a wave expanding matches expected physics,
  Absorbing boundary conditions on 3 walls and reflective boundary condition on one wall .
  Verified model reproduces dependence of wave speed with depth In deep water:  c = ~√g*h
  As the initial spike of water collapses a wave propagates out like a rock in a pond
  Center of collapsing wave overshoots creating a dip
  Absorbing boundary mimics wave exiting a finite simulation region
  Reflective Boundary condition mimics coast
